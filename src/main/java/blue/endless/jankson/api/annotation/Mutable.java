/**
 * Indicates to Jankson that the object is mutable.
 * 
 * <p>If this annotation is present, all non-transient fields on this class and all its superclasses
 * MUST either:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Be public
 *   <li>For fields named "x", have a setter named "setX" which takes a single argument of the type
 *   or a subtype of the field. The return type of such a method may be either void or the type
 *   (or a supertype) of the class it's declared on.
 * </ul>
 * The type held in each field need not be mutable, just the field itself.
 * 
 * <p>This annotation can be used as a hint to Jankson to operate in streaming mode when
 * deserializing objects / fields of this type.
